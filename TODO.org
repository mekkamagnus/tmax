*** DONE 0.2.1 T-Lisp tokenizer and parser: Complete lexical analysis and AST generation
*** DONE 0.2.2 Evaluation engine: Full interpreter with lexical scoping
*** DONE 0.2.3 Standard library: 31 built-in functions
*** DONE 0.2.4 Macro system: Full quasiquote support with compile-time expansion
*** DONE 0.2.5 Interactive REPL: Complete development environment for T-Lisp
*** DONE 0.2.6 Tail-call optimization: Trampoline pattern prevents stack overflow
*** DONE 0.2.7 add cond to standard library
** DONE 0.3 Modal Editor
*** DONE 0.3.1 Modal editing system: Five modes (normal, insert, visual, command, M-x)
*** DONE 0.3.2 Key binding system: Configurable mappings with mode-specific behavior
*** DONE 0.3.3 Editor API: 25+ T-Lisp functions for complete editor control
*** DONE 0.3.4 Command interfaces: Both vim-style (:q, :w) and M-x (SPC ;) commands
*** DONE 0.3.5 Buffer management: Multiple buffers with efficient switching
*** DONE 0.3.6 Configuration system: .tmaxrc files with T-Lisp scripting
** TODO 0.4 Refactor Key Binding System to be T-Lisp Centric [1/4]
*** TODO 0.4.1 Introduce T-Lisp Keymaps [0/2]
    TODO 0.4.1.1 Implement a `hash-map` or `association-list` data type in T-Lisp standard library
    TODO 0.4.1.2 Define variables in T-Lisp to hold the keymaps for each mode (e.g., `*normal-mode-keymap*`)
    STATUS: Currently using T-Lisp built-in functions (cons, car, cdr, member, nth) but lacks formal hash-map/association-list types and mode-specific keymap variables
*** DONE 0.4.2 Move Default Bindings to a Core T-Lisp File [1/2]
    DONE Default bindings using T-Lisp: All key bindings defined through executeCommand() calls using T-Lisp (key-bind) function
    TODO 0.4.2.1 Create `src/tlisp/core-bindings.tlisp` file: Move hardcoded executeCommand() calls to separate .tlisp file and load at startup
    TODO 0.4.2.2 Remove `initializeDefaultKeyMappings()` from editor.ts: Replace with loading core-bindings.tlisp file
*** TODO 0.4.3 Refactor the TypeScript Key Handling Engine [1/3]
    TODO 0.4.3.1 Remove TypeScript `keyMappings` Map from editor.ts: Replace with T-Lisp environment queries
    TODO 0.4.3.2 Update `handleKey()` to query T-Lisp environment: Look up commands in T-Lisp keymaps instead of TypeScript Map
    DONE TypeScript as "dumb" executor: handleKey() executes T-Lisp commands but still uses TypeScript keyMappings Map
    STATUS: Partial - TypeScript executes T-Lisp commands but still maintains its own keyMappings Map instead of pure T-Lisp lookup
*** TODO 0.4.4 Re-implement (key-bind) in T-Lisp [0/2]
    TODO 0.4.4.1 Remove built-in `(key-bind)` function from editor.ts: Move from TypeScript built-in to pure T-Lisp implementation
    TODO 0.4.4.2 Implement `(key-bind)` in T-Lisp standard library: Function should modify T-Lisp keymap variables instead of TypeScript Map
    TODO 0.4.4.3 Create `src/tlisp/stdlib.ts`: New file for T-Lisp standard library including (key-bind), (get-binding), (remove-binding), (list-bindings)
    STATUS: Currently implemented as TypeScript built-in function, needs to become pure T-Lisp function

** TODO 0.5 init.tlisp Configuration
   Support for an `init.tlisp` file for user configuration, similar to Emacs' `init.el`.
*** Instructions
   - This will require updating all documentation (README.md, docs/manual/tmax.texi, etc.) to remove mentions of `.tmaxrc` and replace with `init.tlisp`.

* Phase 1: Enhanced Editing (v0.2.0)
** TODO 1.1 Local Development Package Directories
   For development, support `tlisp/` and `tlpa/` directories in the project root.
   `tlisp/` is for personal scripts.
   `tlpa/` is for third-party packages.

** TODO 1.2 Advanced Text Objects
   Support for text objects like `ciw`, `daw`, etc.
** TODO 1.3 Visual Selection Modes
   Enhancements to visual selection capabilities.
** TODO 1.4 Jump Commands
   Implementation of jump commands such as `gg`, `G`, and `:line_number`.
** TODO 1.5 Search Functionality
   Adding search features like `/`, `n`, and `N`.
** TODO 1.6 Syntax Highlighting
   A framework for syntax highlighting.
** TODO 1.7 Buffer Management
   Improved handling of multiple files.
* Phase 2: Extensibility & Customization (v0.3.0)
** TODO 2.1 Plugin System
   A complete plugin system using T-Lisp, including plugin loading.
   This will include migrating the package directory to `~/.config/tmax/tlpa/`.
** TODO 2.2 Advanced T-Lisp Features
   Introduction of more advanced features to T-Lisp.
** TODO 2.3 Custom Key Binding System
   A system for creating custom key bindings.
** TODO 2.4 Macro Recording/Playback
   The ability to record and playback macros.
** TODO 2.5 Basic Configuration System
   An initial version of the configuration system.
** TODO 2.6 Performance Optimizations
   Further optimizations for performance.
